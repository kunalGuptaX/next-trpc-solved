## Fullstack task

Welcome to spotted.io test. 

You can use any libraries, any utilities that you wish. 

The task should take you around 1 hour - If you have experience with prisma/chakra it should take you around 20-30 minutes.

This is a fullstack test, so make sure you modify the prisma schema, add needed migration, add seed data and implement FE changes.


We have a simple blog which at the moment has these functionalities:
- display a list of posts
- display a single post detail
- add a new post


Your task is to implement:
- when adding new post, you can select tags for the post from a tag input
- (optional) tag input should create a new tag when the user types in any text and confirms with hitting an enter key
- display post's tags on the list of posts for each post
- display post's tags on the post detail

Ideally your code should have at least happy paths tested. When it comes to styling feel free to keep it very basic

When you think you are done with the feature, please send it as zip/tar archive to `jiri.s@spotted.io` and `nick.t@spotted.io` in a copy. Alternatively you can share your solution using a github repository.
